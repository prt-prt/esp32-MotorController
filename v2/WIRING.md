## Pin Configuration

### Control Pins
| ESP32-S2 Mini GPIO | DRV8833 Pin | Function |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| GPIO7              | AIN1        | PWM control for left motor direction 1 |
| GPIO8              | AIN2        | PWM control for left motor direction 2 |
| GPIO9              | BIN1        | PWM control for right motor direction 1 |
| GPIO10             | BIN2        | PWM control for right motor direction 2 |

*Note: The exact GPIO numbers should be adjusted based on your specific board layout and requirements.*

### Power Connections
| Power Source | Connected To | Function |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Powerbank USB output | ESP32-S2 Mini USB-C | Power for microcontroller |
| Powerbank 5V output | Toggle switch | Main power input with on/off control |
| Toggle switch | Step-up converter input | Controls power to motor driver circuit |
| Step-up converter output (6V) | DRV8833 VM | Motor power supply (6V recommended) |
| GND connections | Common ground | All grounds must be connected together |

## Power Supply Architecture

This implementation uses a simplified power supply approach:

1. **Powerbank** serves as the main power source with dual outputs:
   - USB output directly to ESP32-S2 Mini USB-C port (powers the microcontroller)
   - 5V output through a toggle switch to the step-up converter

2. **Global Power Switch**:
   - SPST toggle switch placed between the powerbank and step-up converter
   - Provides a master on/off control for the entire motor system
   - ESP32-S2 Mini can remain powered via USB for programming while motors are disabled

3. **Step-up Converter**:
   - Boosts the 5V from the powerbank to 6V
   - Powers the motors through the DRV8833 driver (VM pin)

This architecture optimizes power usage, simplifies wiring, and provides convenient control.

All GND connections must be common between:
- ESP32-S2 Mini
- DRV8833
- Step-up converter
- Powerbank negative output
```

## Power Supply Considerations

### Powerbank Selection
- Choose a powerbank with at least 2A output capability 
- Must have both USB and direct 5V output options
- USB output powers the ESP32-S2 Mini directly
- 5V output (through switch) powers the motor circuit

### Global Power Switch
- SPST (Single Pole, Single Throw) toggle switch
- Should be rated for at least 2A
- Position the switch in an easily accessible location on the robot
- This allows you to quickly power down the motors without disconnecting the powerbank

### Step-up Converter for Motors
- Converts 5V to 6V for optimal motor performance
- The DRV8833 works well with 6V for small DC motors
- Higher voltage provides better torque and speed
- Efficiency is typically around 85-90%
- Must be able to handle the peak current of both motors running simultaneously

### ESP32-S2 Mini Power
- Powered directly via USB-C port
- Has built-in power regulation
- Can remain powered on while motors are disabled via the global switch
- Simplifies development and debugging process

### Common Ground Connection
- All ground connections must be tied together
- This ensures proper signal transmission and prevents floating reference issues
- Create a central ground point or "star ground" for all components

## DRV8833 Control Logic

The DRV8833 uses a more streamlined approach to motor control compared to traditional drivers:

1. **Both Direction and Speed Control**: Each motor requires two PWM pins (AIN1/AIN2 for left motor, BIN1/BIN2 for right motor)
2. **No Separate Enable Pins**: Direction and speed are controlled by the PWM duty cycle on the input pins

### Motor Control Logic
| Motor Function | AIN1/BIN1 | AIN2/BIN2 | Result |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Forward        | PWM       | 0         | Motor rotates forward at speed proportional to PWM |
| Backward       | 0         | PWM       | Motor rotates backward at speed proportional to PWM |
| Coast (free)   | 0         | 0         | Motor is disconnected (free rotation) |
| Brake (lock)   | 1         | 1         | Motor terminals are shorted (active braking) |

### Robot Movement Control
| Robot Movement | Left Motor      | Right Motor     |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Forward        | AIN1=PWM, AIN2=0 | BIN1=PWM, BIN2=0 |
| Backward       | AIN1=0, AIN2=PWM | BIN1=0, BIN2=PWM |
| Turn Left      | AIN1=0, AIN2=PWM | BIN1=PWM, BIN2=0 |
| Turn Right     | AIN1=PWM, AIN2=0 | BIN1=0, BIN2=PWM |
| Stop           | AIN1=0, AIN2=0   | BIN1=0, BIN2=0   |

## Troubleshooting

### Motors Not Responding
- Check if the toggle switch is in the ON position
- Verify power connections (VM and GND on DRV8833)
- Ensure the step-up converter is outputting approximately 6V
- Confirm motor connections to AOUT and BOUT pins
- Verify control pin connections between ESP32-S2 Mini and DRV8833

### ESP32-S2 Mini Not Powering Up
- Check USB connection to powerbank
- Try a different USB cable
- Verify the powerbank has sufficient charge

### Motors Running In Wrong Direction
- Swap the motor terminal connections (AOUT1/AOUT2 or BOUT1/BOUT2)
- Or modify the control logic in the code to invert the direction

### Inconsistent Motor Behavior
- Check all ground connections are properly connected together
- Verify the step-up converter is providing stable voltage
- Ensure toggle switch makes good contact and doesn't create intermittent connections

### Electrical Noise Issues
- Keep signal wires away from motor wires where possible
- Add 0.1μF ceramic capacitors across motor terminals if experiencing noise issues
- Consider adding ferrite beads on motor wires

### Power Management Issues
- If powerbank auto-shuts off, look for a model with "always on" capability
- For longer run times, consider a powerbank with higher capacity (10,000mAh+)
- If the system resets when motors start, ensure powerbank can provide sufficient current
